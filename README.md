Steps
1) Once a user runs the node application, a table of the available products will be displayed: 

<img src="/screenshot/table.png" alt="start" title="Start" width="500" height="450" />

2) The user can enter in the ID of the product and the number of units that they want to procure

<img src="/screenshot/insufficient.png" alt="start" title="Start" width="500" height="50" />

3) If the requested units are not available an "Insufficient Quantity!" message will be shown, otherwise the table will be updated and the user will now see remaining units for the item.
